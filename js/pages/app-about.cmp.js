            <h2>About the App</h2>
            <p>Appsus is a single web application integrating two sister apps, in one. The first app, Keepsus, allows users to save notes for future reference. The app supports simple text notes, to-do lists and the ability to save and display images and videos. The second app, Appmail, is an email app allowing sending and receiving emails. We hope you enjoy our app at least as much as we enjoyed making it</p>
